# Docker Containerization Learning Guide üê≥

## Introduction

Welcome to hands-on Docker containerization learning guide! üöÄ This guide is designed to help you create your own Docker containers using both the command-line interface (CLI) and Docker Compose. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a good understanding of how to containerize applications using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Node.js: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Building a Docker Container with CLI

## Step 1 

### First Step update vite.config (The project using vite so we have to do this)

```
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    watch: {
      usePolling: true,
    },
    host: true,
    port: 3000,
  },
});
```

## Step 2 

### Option 1: Use the provided Dockerfile
In this project check the root directory we have a basic Dockerfile.If you have it you skip this step or you can create one.

### Option 2: Create a Dockerfile
In your project directory, create a Dockerfile.

## Step 3 


### Create a .dockerignore file 

In the root directory of your project create a file named .dockerignore and then you can use the below.

```
node_modules/
dist/
*.log
```

## Step 4

### Create your first image

Now, you can build the Docker image using the docker build command. Replace the-image-name with your desired image name. Execute the following command:

```
docker build -t the-image-name .
```

## Step 5 

### Check your image from CLI 

Now, you can check your docker image if its exist or not by using this command. Execute the following : 

```
docker images
```

If you can see the image you created lets do step 6 !  ‚úÖ

## Step 6 

### Create your first Docker Container

After building the Docker image, you can create and run a container from it using the docker run command. This command also maps port 3000 in the container to port 3000 on the host system. Replace the-image-name with the name you used during the build step:

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 the-image-name
```

-d runs the container in the background.
-p 3000:3000 maps port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on the host.


**If everything goes on the way. Your image and container created now we can check by opening any browser you like and check the  http://localhost:3000  Enjoy your Docker containerized application! üê≥**
